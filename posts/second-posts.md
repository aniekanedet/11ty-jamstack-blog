## Dear young friend.

Learn to challenge your thinking beyond your climate, see what is going on in the world, use the internet, and keep challenging your mind.
When you read/study a Book/a Course, do it for the benefit of Learning not necessarily to pass an exam or to win an award or to get a certificate, Which of course are all nice to have.
Read and bring Data & Information beyond your known experiences into your life.
When you take Data & Information bigger than your mind, you are compelling your entire system to go higher.
Have a most productive week ahead!
